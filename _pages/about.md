Hi~ I am Mengming Li (李孟明 in Chinese). I am a Ph.D. student at the Electronic and Computer Engineering Department of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), advised by Prof. [Zhiyao Xie](https://zhiyaoxie.com/). Before joining HKUST, I received my Master's degree at Zhejiang University, advised by Prof. [Kai Bu](https://list.zju.edu.cn/kaibu/), and my bachelor's degree from Guangdong Ocean University.
